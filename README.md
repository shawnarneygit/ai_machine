### Predicting Tomorrow's Bitcoin Price
Predicting the next day’s Bitcoin closing price on a daily timeframe, our SARIMAX baseline achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error **(MAPE) of 1.77%** and an Mean Absolute Error **(MAE) of $898.27**. 

A Lasso regression model offered only a marginal improvement—reducing MAE by about $2—while matching the same 1.77% MAPE. 

Overall, SARIMAX remains a strong benchmark for daily Bitcoin price forecasts.

**ML Project with code, and data visualizations and analysis: Available via walkthru over Zoom.  Not open to the public.**
